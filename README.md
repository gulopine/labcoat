This library is dedicated to Michael Foord, who inspired me to create it by lamenting that he couldn't write Python tests using natural language. He inspired countless people to improve the quality of their code and peocesses through testing, and he was always encouraging people to get involved in thr Python community at large.

Thank you, Michael
